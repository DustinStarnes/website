          Hello, my name is Dustin Starnes! I am a web developer and designer. I
          attended school at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis.
          I majored in Media Arts and Science focused in Web Development. I
          started coding when I was younger and was always fascinated with it. I
          wanted to make websites soon after I wrote my first line of code. My
          skills are pretty solid in html, CSS, JavaScript, php, and python. I
          sometimes try to figure out the backend but if I could stick with the
          front-end development, that’s where I’m happy at. I do other things
          besides coding. When I have spare time, you can find me riding my
          mountain bike in the trails, planting plants all over the place, in
          the ceramics studio making pots and mugs, or at the gym hitting the
          weights. The biggest thing I like about myself if the fact that I can
          see the big picture in things!
